# Welcome to Notasi!

Notasi is designed for 2 different types of people:

 - People who want to care about data, but don't know what data they've got
 - People who don't want to care about data, but have to

# Design Principles

<h3> Ease of use over performance </h3>
Instead of stressing about perfectly structuring their data, they tell Notasi how a piece of information is identified (business keys) and what changes to the information they care about (e.g. email address but not last read time). Notasi handles the rest.  
        
<h3> Designed to be outgrown </h3>
Notasi has been built to have the lowest possible barrier of entry. While scaling Notasi should be possible, itâ€™s designed to help users solve problems quickly without knowing all the answers. Once you're annoyed with Notasi's limitations it's probably time to graduate to a proper enterprise data hub/lake.  
        
<h3>Only basic SQL skills needed </h3>
if you understand:

```SQL
SELECT 
	column 
FROM 
	tab1 
	inner join tab2 on tab1.x = tab2.y
```

then you can implement and use Notasi

# Installation

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tullyclark/notasi/master/install/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh

You will then be stepped through the setup process. 

Once complete, open `http://localhost` to set up the first user
